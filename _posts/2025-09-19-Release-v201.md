The new v2.0.1 version is now available for android. It's holiday season, so this update only includes some small bugfixes.

## Correct password was treated as incorrect
We received some feedback that in some cases a valid password was rejected as incorrect. This happened when first entering an incorrect password and then providing the correct one.
A smiliar, related issue was also fixed: When reloading the app (e.g. due to changing the language or restoring a backup), an incorrect password was treated as a correct one.

## Tag overview improvements
If no tags are available, the tag overview now displays an "empty tags" view. This makes the overall UI more consistent.
Additionally, it is no longer possible to save or create tags with an empty name.

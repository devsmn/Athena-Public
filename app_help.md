        A new document can consist of multiple sources. You can combine a picture taken with your camera, an image chosen from your gallery and a PDF selected from your device into a single document. </br>
        Documents are always stored locally as PDFs on your device.</br>
        The AI text detection feature helps you to quickly find the documents you need. With the help of AI, all sources are scanned for text. Found text is then available in the search when using the full text search             option, i.e. you can search for all documents that contain a specific text.&nbsp;

        In the search tab, you can search for documents with a specific name, or for specific text within documents.
        To search for specific text within documents, enable the <strong>full text search</strong> option.
        In this example, the user wants to find all documents that contain the text <strong>note</strong>.
        </br>
        By default, only full words are searched. If you want to search for partial words, add a * after the search text,
        <u>Example</u>:&nbsp;
        A search for <strong>note </strong>will not yield documents that contain the text notepad - only those that contain the word <strong>note</strong>.
        However, a search with <strong>note*</strong> will yield documents that contain the word <strong>notepad </strong>as well as <strong>note</strong>.

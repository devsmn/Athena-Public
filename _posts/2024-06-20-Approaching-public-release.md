The google play closed alpha testing stage soon comes to an end. As of today, 7 days are left until I can apply for production and thus release the app to the public.

Since the core functionality is already working well and there's still a bit of time left, the first public version will be v1.1.x.

v1.1.x contains a major redesign of the UI and other, smaller changes.

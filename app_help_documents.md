## Summary
With Athena, you can create documents based on multiple sources, such as images and PDFs. The resulting document is stored as a PDF locally on your device. 
When creating a document, you can opt-in to extract text, which can later be used in the "Search" tab for a full-text-search over all available documents.

## Details
### Creating a document
<div class="container" align="center">
    <img src="../assets/img/documents.jpg" width="180" height="400" />
    <p align="left">
       Documents are always located within a folder. To add a new document, use the plus button in the lower right corner.
    </p>
</div>

### Choosing the scanner
<div class="container" align="center">
    <img src="../assets/img/documents2.jpg" width="180" height="400" />
    <p align="left">
      When adding a document for the first time, you can decide whether to use the advanced scanner (recommended) or the legacy one. This option can always be changed in the settings.
    </p>
</div>

### Sources and scanning documents
<div class="container" align="center">
    <img src="../assets/img/documents3.jpg" width="180" height="400" />
    <p align="left">
      Currently, three document-sources are supported:
      <ol align="left">
      <li>Images/Documents scanned with the document scanner using your camera</li>
      <li>Images in your gallery</li>
      <li>PDFs on your device</li>
      </ol>
      Use the Scan button to scan a document or to select an image from your gallery. Documents are detected automatically and after the scan was successful, visual enhancements are applied. 
    </p>
</div>

<div class="container" align="center">
    <img src="../assets/img/documents3.jpg" width="180" height="400" />
    <p align="left">
      Documents are detected and scanned automatically. 
    </p>
</div>

<div class="container" align="center">
    <img src="../assets/img/documents3.jpg" width="180" height="400" />
    <p align="left">
      After scanning, visual enhancements are applied automatically. You can adjust the settings if needed and also scan more than one document at once. Use the done button to close the scanner.
    </p>
</div>


<div class="container" align="center">
    <img src="../assets/img/documents3.jpg" width="180" height="400" />
    <p align="left">
      Scanned documents and PDFs are displayed under documents. You can use the Delete document button to remove the related document from the selection.
    </p>

### OCR (Text detection)
<div class="container" align="center">
    <img src="../assets/img/documents3.jpg" width="180" height="400" />
    <p align="left">
      Athena supports detecting text in images and documents. To use the OCR feature, it has to be set up when using it for the first time. See (Setting up OCR)[https://devsmn.de/app_help_settings_ocr.md] for further information.
      Enable the "Detect text in documents" option to detect text when creating the document.
